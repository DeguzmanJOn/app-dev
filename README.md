## Information about my favoritr series
- this drama about marital discord and a potential second-chance romance.
- Queen of Tears does best is balance its tragic storyline with small comedic moments, so its gloomy overtones don't feel too overwhelming, but also so its real tear-jerking scenes have an even bigger impact.
- Hae-in and Hyun-woo's lives flash before our eyes, showing us that they truly did keep their promise to one another and stayed by each other's side for as long as they lived.
